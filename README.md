## Welcome to Oxidize

This project is an Operating System written in Rust. The proposal of this system is build a modulable and functional OS built from scratch.

## Getting Started

Clone the project:

```
git clone git@github.com:vgsantoniazzi/oxidize.git
```

## Usage

##### Compile

```
make build
```

##### Run

```
make all
```

## Useful resources

I've been researching about Operating Systems in Rust. Some of these articles guided me through the first steps, and others I'm using as a research playbook. Feel free to use them as well to build your own operating system.

[cfenollosa/os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial)

Nice walkthrough and explains details about every little piece of an operating system. In ASM.

[phil-opp/blog_os](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os)

Incredible playbook how to create your own operating system in Rust. I used his blog to do my first steps.
I have plans to write my bootloader in ASM and link to Rust compiled code.

[lectures/os-dev.pdf](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf)

Nice book that explains a lot about BIOS, Boot, and Disk.

This text is a practical guide to writing your own x86 operating system. It is designed to give enough help with the technical details.
